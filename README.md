# JAVASCRIPT-PROJECTS

 <h1>Real-time Weather app</h1>

This project will show you how to create a weather app using Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. For getting meteorological information, the instructor uses the Dark Sky API, which is a terrific opportunity for you to learn how to communicate with APIs, which is another great thing you can do with JavaScript. The only issue you might have is figuring out how to use JavaScript to interact with an API. But believe me when I say that won’t be an issue.

In this app you’re going to make: our weather app will display weather data from the API like this: an icon that represents the current weather status, the temperature value (18°C) in Celsius units, the weather description (clear sky), and finally the user’s city and country (London, GB).

<h1>Movie App</h1>

This is a movie app made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap using API calls from The Movie Database. It uses API calls to get movies from The Movie Database. Users can view the most popular movies, arrange them by genre, or use the search function to find other titles.

<h1>Real-Time Chat Application</h1>

How about we build our own chat application? We’ll make a full-fledged real-time chat application. On the front end, we’ll use React, and on the back end, we’ll utilize NodeJS and the Socket.io web socket library. By the end of this project, you’ll know how to use web sockets and Socket.io to send and receive messages in order to create any real-time application.

Covered topics: React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io.

<h1>File Sharing App</h1>

You need a file-sharing app every time you want to share files from one device to the other. This is a demonstration app that illustrates how to utilize the Virgil Crypto Library in JavaScript to construct a secure file-sharing app. You will be able to download, decrypt, and view encrypted media files from a browser after completing the procedures in the setup section.

<h1> Instagram Clone</h1>

Instagram is a famous social media site used to share photos. After completing this project, you will be able to create a perfect clone of Instagram. However, there is a challenge. Users should be able to enjoy features comparable to those found on Instagram. For instance, image upload, tagging, and likes.

The source code given below is of an Instagram clone. This app features all the latest tools and practices in web development-

React JS — A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Node JS — A web framework for Node JS
Postgres — A cross-platform and open-source document-oriented database
Redis — A platform for caching
JWT — A library for authentication of users
Context — A state handler<
